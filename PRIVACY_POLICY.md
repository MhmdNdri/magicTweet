# Privacy Policy for Magic Tweet

**Last updated:** [Current Date]

This Privacy Policy describes how Magic Tweet ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our browser extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

We want to be crystal clear: **We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

- **Twitter/X Information:** The extension interacts with your Twitter/X account on your local machine to read the text you're composing and to receive AI-generated suggestions. This information is processed locally and is never sent to our servers.
- **Authentication:** When you authenticate your Twitter/X account, the necessary authentication tokens are stored locally on your computer using the browser's secure storage. We do not have access to these tokens.
- **Analytics:** We do not use any tracking or analytics services. We have no way of knowing who you are or how you use the extension.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect your information, we do not use it for any purpose. The extension's functionality is self-contained within your browser. The only external communication is with the AI providers (OpenAI, XAI, Gemini) that you select to generate tweet suggestions. We do not control the privacy policies of these third-party services.

## 3. Information Sharing

We do not have any of your personal information to share.

## 4. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information that is stored locally by the extension. All sensitive data, such as authentication tokens, is handled using standard browser security features.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
